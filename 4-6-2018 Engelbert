     This file has to be a valid script, meaning that it
     can be executed by Coq.
     Therefore, explanations in natural language have to be between
     comment markers.

     In this project template, text within square brackets (within
     comment markers) is intended to clarify what needs to be

     In the final version, we expect that all these blocks have been

   Abstract:
   =========
   [
     For the intermediate version of this project:
     Explain briefly which perspective of which artifact will be
     studied and why this topic has been chosen.
     
     
    In this project, a cow milking device, which consists of a pulsator and a vacuum pump 
    connected to the teats of a cow will be studied,
    to investigate how such a device can result in a milk bottle being filled.
    This topic is chosen in this project due to an interesting story of one of the authors.
    She told the story of her dream of ice skating cows, which led to a conversation,
    between the authors about cows and their mutual interest in production of milk and the countryside.
    Since, milking of cows can be done non-automatically (with the hands),
    we were interested in the automatic side to the milking of cows via the usage of a cow milking device
    and thus it was decided to choose a cow milking device as the artefact of the project.

     
   ]

   [
     And for the final version of this project:
     Explain whether you managed to prove the correctness theorem.
     And how did that go: did you have to change a lot compared to
     the intermediate version, or could you use your formalization
     without many modifications?

   Focus:

   Modeling Goal:
   ==============
   Verification model

   Fragment of reality:
   ====================
   Cow milking device which consists of a vacuum pump, pulsator, teat cups, milk tube, power strip, and receiving bottle.
   Beside the milking device, we need a cow (that is able to produce milk), air, and a electricity supplier.

  Perspective:
   ============
   The simplified cow milking machine, milks cows
   automatically at the correct moment and when the bottle is filled, it stops milking.

   Abstractions or simplifications:
   ================================
   [
     Depending on the chosen focus, you may simplify certain aspects of
     your artifact.
     If you are modeling some kind of home automation system, it is not
     unreasonable to assume that the net power is constant, although this
     is not exactly the case in reality. However, if you are modeling an
     artifact that protects against high peaks of power, these fluctuations
     should be part of the model.

     Write down explicitly which assumptions you have made to simplify
     the artifact.
   ]

    We are assuming that the time the cow takes to fill the receiving bottle is consistent,
    meaning that the amount of milk given over a period of time is always the same.
    Thus, the speed of milking is always the same and the total amount of milk (and hence the time being milked),
    is alwaysthe same.     
    Lastly, we are assuming that the outputs and the inputs from the power strip donâ€™t fluctuate with
    respect to the power.

     It is very likely that you do not need any extras!

     However, if it turns out during your proof that you have to prove
     several times (almost) the same, then you may define a 'Lemma' at
     this place, followed by its proof. And in the proof of the correctness
     theorem, you may apply this lemma several times.
     Note that it is always allowed to add lemmas to this script!

     Sometimes it happens that Coq has troubles with 'trivial' properties
     of numbers, that cannot be solve easily using 'lin_solve'.
     In such situations, you may contact your supervisor and discuss
     whether this may be solved by adding an 'Axiom', which can also be
     applied later on within the proof of the correctness theorem.
